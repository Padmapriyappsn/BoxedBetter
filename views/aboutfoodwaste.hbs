            <h2>The Importance of Reducing Food Waste</h2>
            <p>
                Reducing food waste is crucial for environmental sustainability and economic savings. In Canada, a significant portion of food loss occurs in institutional settings like schools, with elementary schools discarding approximately 218.2 million meals annually.

                For students, minimizing food waste not only contributes to environmental conservation but also offers financial benefits. By planning meals and avoiding over-purchasing, students can save money and reduce their ecological footprint.

                Educational institutions play a vital role in addressing food waste. Implementing strategies such as improved food ordering, preparation, and storage can significantly reduce waste. Additionally, recovering surplus food to donate to those in need supports community welfare.
