                <br><p>BoxedBetter is a web-based surplus food marketplace that aims to reduce food waste while providing students in need with affordable meal options. We connect students with restaurants that have surplus food nearing closing time and offer it at a 75% discount.</p>
                <br><p>We use location-based technology to match registered students with nearby restaurants. When a restaurant posts discounted food, we send alerts to students, allowing them to quickly pick up the food before it closes for the day.</p>
                <br><p>Our mission is to reduce food waste, support local businesses, and make food accessible to those who need it most.</p>

                <h1>How It Works</h1>
                <p>Our platform connects restaurants with surplus food to students in need by leveraging location-based technology. Here's how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For Restaurants:</strong> Post surplus food nearing closing time at a 75% discount.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Students:</strong> Register with your location, and receive alerts when nearby restaurants offer discounted meals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pickup:</strong> Go to the restaurant to pick up your discounted food before they close.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
